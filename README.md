# Automatic-Pnuematic-Lift-Door
This project implements an automatic electro-pneumatic door system using an IR sensor, Arduino Uno, solenoid DCV, and relay. The IR sensor detects an object, activating the Arduino to trigger the relay, which controls the solenoid DCV to regulate air pressure for door operation. Ideal for lifts and automated entry systems.
